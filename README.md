Simple Doctrine Mapping for Symfony2
=====

*KISS*, Remember?

This bundle streamlines and reduces the complexity of the Doctrine mapping process. the
first premise to use this bundle is disable, if enabled, the
`auto_mapping` config definition of your managers. Once active, hands-on
work, we will define specifically how your entities map to your ORM.

SimpleDoctrineMapping offers you just an abstract compiler pass with one method,
enough to make your project work.

Repeat with me, *Keep it simple*

CompilerPass
------------

For those of you who still do not know what is a CompilerPass, try to visualize
it as your last chance to configure your container. At this point you can
retrieve all your parameter configuration, but you cannot build any service, this
is the point where you can dynamically build and complete services.

Once compiled, this container will be read-only.

This CompilerPass let each bundle be responsible for its own entities, defining
per each one, the class to be mapped, the path of the mapping file and the
manager that will manage it.

You should create your own compiler pass


``` php
<?php

/**
 * SimpleDoctrineMapping for Symfony2
 */

namespace TestBundle\CompilerPass;

use Symfony\Component\DependencyInjection\ContainerBuilder;

use Mmoreram\SimpleDoctrineMapping\CompilerPass\Abstracts\AbstractMappingCompilerPass;

/**
 * Class MappingCompilerPass
 */
class MappingCompilerPass extends AbstractMappingCompilerPass
{
    /**
     * You can modify the container here before it is dumped to PHP code.
     *
     * @param ContainerBuilder $container
     *
     * @api
     */
    public function process(ContainerBuilder $container)
    {
        $this
            ->addEntityMapping(
                $container,
                'default',
                'TestBundle\Entity\User',
                '@TestBundle/Mapping/User.orm.yml',
                true
            )
        ;
    }
}
```

and add it into the Container. Like this:

``` php
    <?php

    /**
     * SimpleDoctrineMapping for Symfony2
     */

    namespace Mmoreram\SimpleDoctrineMapping\Tests\Functional\TestBundle;

    use Symfony\Component\DependencyInjection\ContainerBuilder;
    use Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\Bundle\Bundle;

    use Mmoreram\SimpleDoctrineMapping\Tests\Functional\TestBundle\CompilerPass\MappingCompilerPass;

    /**
     * Class TestBundle
     */
    class TestBundle extends Bundle
    {
        /**
         * @param ContainerBuilder $container
         */
        public function build(ContainerBuilder $container)
        {
            $container->addCompilerPass(new MappingCompilerPass());
        }
    }
```

And that's it. After the container compilation it will add our mapping
information. No magic.


addEntityMapping()
------------------

The method *addEntityMapping()* does not offer us many options, but the necessary
to be able to define the entity map in most cases.


``` php
    /**
     * Add mapping entity
     *
     * This method adds a new Driver into global MappingDriverChain with single
     * entity mapping information.
     *
     * $entityManagerName must be an existing entityManager. By default doctrine
     * creates just one common EntityManager called default, but many can be
     * defined with different connection information
     *
     * p.e. default
     * p.e. anotherEntityManager
     *
     * $entityNamespace must be an existing namespace of Entity. This value also
     * can be a valid and existing container parameter, with an existing
     * namespace of an Entity as value.
     *
     * p.e. MyBundle\Entity\User
     * p.e. mybundle.entity.user.class
     *
     * $entityMappingFilePath must be a path of an existing yml or xml file with
     * mapping information about $entityNamespace. This bundle uses Short Bundle
     * notation, with "@" symbol. This value also can be a valid and existing
     * container parameter, with a path to an existing yml or xml file as value.
     *
     * p.e. @MyBundle/Resources/config/doctrine/User.orm.yml
     * p.e. @MyBundle/Resources/config/doctrine/User.orm.xml
     * p.e. mybundle.entity.user.mapping_file_path
     *
     * Finally, $enable flag just allow you to add current mapping definition
     * into all Doctrine Map table, or just dismiss it. This is useful when you
     * want to give possibility to final user to enable or disable a mapping
     * class.
     *
     * @param ContainerBuilder $container             Container
     * @param string           $entityManagerName     EntityManager name
     * @param string           $entityNamespace       Entity namespace
     * @param string           $entityMappingFilePath Entity Mapping file path
     * @param boolean          $enable                Entity mapping must be included
     *
     * @return $this self Object
     *
     * @throws EntityManagerNotFound Entity Manager not found
     */
    protected function addEntityMapping(
        ContainerBuilder $container,
        $entityManagerName,
        $entityNamespace,
        $entityMappingFilePath,
        $enable = true
    )
```

Of course, all values are required but the last one.

Parameters
----------

So, imagine that you are working in a public Bundle, I mean, your bundle will be
installed by other projects in their vendor folder, but you want to expose your
own entity model.

You could think that by using this bundle you force the final user to use your
model implementation in all cases, but is not.

If you want to give this power to your users, if you want to expose overridable
entities, you can define your model using container parameters.

``` yml
parameters:

    #
    # Mapping information
    #
    test_bundle.entity.user.class: "TestBundle\Entity\User"
    test_bundle.entity.user.mapping_file_path: "@TestBundle/Mapping/Class.orm.yml"
    test_bundle.entity.user.entity_manager: default
    test_bundle.entity.user.enable: true
```

In that case your bundle will put at users mercy the ability to
override all the required parameters by just overriding specific configuration
items.

You must finally create these params with your default values.

``` php
<?php

/**
 * SimpleDoctrineMapping for Symfony2
 */

namespace TestBundle\CompilerPass;

use Symfony\Component\DependencyInjection\ContainerBuilder;

use Mmoreram\SimpleDoctrineMapping\CompilerPass\Abstracts\AbstractMappingCompilerPass;

/**
 * Class MappingCompilerPass
 */
class MappingCompilerPass extends AbstractMappingCompilerPass
{
    /**
     * You can modify the container here before it is dumped to PHP code.
     *
     * @param ContainerBuilder $container
     *
     * @api
     */
    public function process(ContainerBuilder $container)
    {
        $this
            ->addEntityMapping(
                $container,
                'test_bundle.entity.user.entity_manager',
                'test_bundle.entity.user.class',
                'test_bundle.entity.user.mapping_file_path',
                'test_bundle.entity.user.enable'
            )
        ;
    }
}
```
